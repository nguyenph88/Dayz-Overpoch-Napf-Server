//Edit for custom loot
DZE_MissionLootTable = true;

DZE_SelfTransfuse = true;

DZE_requireplot = 0;               // no need plotpole
DZE_StaticConstructionCount = 1;   // reduce 3 steps building to 1 step

DZE_R3F_WEIGHT = false; //remove weight

DZE_DeathMsgGlobal = true;
DZE_DeathMsgSide = true;
DZE_DeathMsgTitleText = true;

DZE_GodModeBase = true;            // indestructible bases
